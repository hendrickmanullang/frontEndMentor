### What I learned

- You can use the ```<del>TEXT HERE</del>``` to create a text element with a strikethrough, however, it's not very common usage (https://caniuse.com/?search=del).
- Pay attention to break points media queries - it may be easier to design mobile first and scale up for desktop view.
