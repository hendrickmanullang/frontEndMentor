## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library and [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

### What I learned

- React CSS Modules can be handy if you want to create component-specific styles that might share names with other components
- Native CSS Transitions don't work as well with React (e.g. background color transitions for hover states)

### Continued development

- Look into using CSS Transitions
